# Pour-Decision
## Description
Pour Decision is a quick and easy way to get a recipe for a meal and a drink. The app returns a meal and drink card with ingredients, photographs, and a recipe.  Don't like the results? Run the search again! The results are random. And if you like the drink but want a new meal, or vis versa, check the Remember Me checkbox and the app will keep the results for that category.
